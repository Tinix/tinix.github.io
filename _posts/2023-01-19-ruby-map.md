The Ruby library includes the module Enumerable. This library contains
map(), reduce(), select(), and other functions. 

Map
This function of the Ruby Enumerable library is simple but profound. The map() method is applied to an array or a hash. The job of map() is to apply a function or block to each member of the array and return a new array.
So, when you see


{% highlight ruby %}

def f(x)
  xx
end

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight ruby %}

output_array = [1,2,3,4,5].map do |number|
  f(number)
end

{% endhighlight %}

you read, for each number in [1,2,3,4,5] apply f(x) to return the array
[f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5)]. In this case, the answer is [1,4,9,16,25].
One could encode it in traditional imperative programming as follows:

{% highlight ruby %}

output_array = []
for number in 1..5
  output_array.push( f(number) )
end

{% endhighlight %}

Using map, for example:

{% highlight ruby %}

output_array = [1,2,3,4,5].map do |number|
  number * number
end

{% endhighlight %}

Or, you could encode it as follows:


{% highlight ruby %}

output_array = [1,2,3,4,5].map{|element| element * element}

{% endhighlight %}

[1,2,3,4,5] is the array. The function (or block) to be applied to each
element is {|element| element*element }.
With the { } syntax, or the do-end syntax, the object in the vertical bars
(represented by element) is the element of the array currently being acted
upon by the block, and the last object in any function or block is the return
value, so element*element is returned. The net result is the following:

{% highlight ruby %}

[1,4,9,16,25]

{% endhighlight %}

Suppose you wanted to provide data to a graphing program that
plotted the square of the value.

{% highlight ruby %}

[1,2,3,4,5].map{|element| [element, element* element]}

{% endhighlight %}

In this case, each “point” is a tuple (array) with an element and its
square. This returns the following:


{% highlight ruby %}

[[1,1],[2,4],[3,9],[4,16],[5,25]]

{% endhighlight %}

The difference is that the block returns an array each time with the
number and its square, so the result is an array of arrays.
Since map returns an array, you can cascade map calls. For example,
you could have a map block square each element, and then a second map
block add 100. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}

[1,2,3,4,5].map do |number|
  number * number
end.map do |square|
  square + 100
end

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight ruby %}
=> [101, 104, 109, 116, 125]
{% endhighlight %}

A number of the more complex operations can be solved by cascading with map calls.
