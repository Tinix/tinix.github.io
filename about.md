I love work with Ruby and another language also Free/Open Source technologies and being able to contribute to them. Always involved in several projects some personal..., 
I enjoy trying new technologies and learning something new everyday. 
I like to spend my free time with friends, and I like drinking Mate, and 4 languages, but all that means almost nothingâ€¦
Vim is my favorite editor because is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.
