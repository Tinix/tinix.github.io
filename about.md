I am a dedicated Software Engineer from Argentina.
I am prolific in Ruby software, along with several other programming languages such as Go, Rust, Elixir & Python. I like to spend my free time with my friends, and also I like drinking Mate. I enjoy every day while I'am working with operating system Linux.
