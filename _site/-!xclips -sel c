I love working with Ruby and  Free/Open Source technologies and being able to contribute to them. Always involved in several projects some personal..., I enjoy trying new technologies and learning something new everyday. I like to spend my free time with friends, and I like have Mate, and 4 languages, but all that means almost nothingâ€¦
however I enjoy every code line and ... nowadays... I am learning Elixir and Phoenix!
